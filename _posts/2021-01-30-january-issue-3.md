Our third issue of The Catalyst revolves around the theme of Green Chemistry. We wanted to kick off the new year by bringing your attention to how the field of Chemistry impacts our environment and can contribute to finding ‘greener’ solutions that can help with pollution and plastic crises, to name a few. Indulge in an array of articles ranging from green alternatives for rocket fuel to the chemistry behind contact lenses.
For a well-balanced read, check out our assorted off-themed articles covering a COVID-19 drug, the life of world-renowned scientist Marie Curie, as well as the effects of soil composition on aroma and taste of crops. 
Finally, we are excited to share with you two new interviews with Dr. Ahi and Dr. Huamán Rodriguez, experts in their respective fields of doping control and human rights, as well as a continuation of our gold nanoparticle series.

A special thank you to our writers, proofreaders, graphic editors and marketing team that helped put together this issue.
 
Happy reading!
