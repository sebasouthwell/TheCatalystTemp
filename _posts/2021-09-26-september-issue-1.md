This September 2021 issue of The Catalyst takes you on a journey through pharmaceutical treatments from a chemistry perspective. Covering a range of well-known diseases, this issue gives you a diverse compilation of articles including newly discovered treatments, unfamiliar but must-have drugs, and even an insight into the darker past of drug development. On the occasion of Spinal Cord Injury Awareness Month, The Catalyst also features a collaboration with King's College London's very own iGEM team. A variety of other topics are also at your disposal, informing you on environmental changes during COVID-19, how the future of electric cars could look like, and what safety measures make your household more breathable. 

We hope you enjoy!
