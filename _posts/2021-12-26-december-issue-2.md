Our second edition of The Catalyst is centred around astrochemistry: from the sky we see, to the composition of planet surfaces we cannot see. You will learn about the birth and death of stars, the essential molecules that make up the universe, the possibility of life on a neighbouring planet, and a lot more. If the wonders of space weren’t enough, you can delve into the world of plastics and how it has been affected by the pandemic or read about our exclusive interview to Dr. Dodani, a chemical biology expert who is involved in cutting edge research. This issue also features a special collaboration with the King’s College London Space Society who have contributed with an intriguing article on the future of mining. 

Enjoy!
