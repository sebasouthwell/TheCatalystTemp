Our spring issue of The Catalyst covers the topic of Nuclear Chemistry. This edition features an array of fascinating articles from how we can reuse nuclear waste to how fusion energy could help solve the pollution crises. 
Off-themed articles such as how the durability of pearls contributes to the field of materials science and the intriguing world of molecular gastronomy provide further reading to anyone not particularly engaged in nuclear chemistry.
Furthermore, this edition features our novel two-part series on Synchrotron Radiation.

A special thank you to our writers, proofreaders, graphic editors and marketing team that helped put together this issue.
 
Happy reading! ☢️♻️✅
