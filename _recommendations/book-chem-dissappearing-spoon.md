description: "The Disappearing Spoon by Sam Kean gives the readers a vision of the periodic table by explaining all of the elements and telling stories about how they were discovered and about the scientists that discovered them for instance. He explains chemistry concepts that may appear in our daily lives in a simple way for everyone to understand. Learn more about the elements involved in wars or in the Manhattan project, how the periodic table was completed, the elements in physics and biology, elements that influence money and politics or even the elements of madness."
