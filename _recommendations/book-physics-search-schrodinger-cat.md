description: "Richard Feynman once said: \"I think I can safely say that nobody really understands quantum mechanics\". However, 'In search of Schrodinger's cat' by John Gribbin gives readers a brief history of the field and a basic understanding of the terminology that can bring you one step closer. This may not be the easiest book to read, and you will probably need to google a lot to really understand the concepts, but I assure you that it will be deeply satisfying once you finish it."
