statement: I am currently a third-year Chemistry with Biomedicine MSci student, working as a proofreader for The Catalyst. I decided to join the magazine because I enjoy researching and learning about the various applications of chemistry, particularly in therapeutics and astrophysics. Outside of university, I enjoy playing the piano, hanging out with friends, and reading.
