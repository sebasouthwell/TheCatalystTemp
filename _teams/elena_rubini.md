statement: I am a third-year student pursuing a BSc in Chemistry with Biomedicine at King's College London. As a Co-Editor and Chief and one of the writing directors, I hope this magazine can not only nurture my curiosity for the field of chemistry, but also that of our readers. I have a profound interest in the healthcare sector, especially in drug discovery and innovation driving new drug therapies and therapeutic delivery techniques.

founding_statement: 'The reason I decided to co-found <i>The Catalyst</i> not only dives into my personal interests within the field, but originates largely from a perceived lack of information when choosing a career path after graduation. Our innovative magazine attempts to address this issue by presenting broader areas within the subject pivoted around industrial applications and academia, ranging from therapeutic to sustainable chemistry and ultimately spreading science communication.
