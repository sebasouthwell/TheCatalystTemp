statement: ​I'm an author for the catalyst and 3rd year Chemistry with Biomedicine student at King’s. I joined the Catalyst to explore the broad spectrum of Chemistry beyond our syllabus and the real impact it has globally! My interests lie in Astro chemistry as well as the innovative approaches scientists take to tackle modern day problems. I write in hopes those who may not study chemistry can still find interest in this fascinating subject.
