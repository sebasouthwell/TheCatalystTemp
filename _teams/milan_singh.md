role: Graphic Editor Director
statement: I am currently in  my third year of Chemistry with Biomedicine at King’s College London. As an undergraduate student myself, I decided to co-found this magazine to inform my peers of various applications and career paths the field has to offer and to reduce the niche aspect that chemistry sometimes appears to have. Being the graphic editor director gave me the opportunity to dive into the world of scientific illustration and blend my interest in graphics with STEM.

founding_statement: Enriching my knowledge about science by reading publications such as Nature has sparked my desire to co-found <i>The Catalyst </i> and tailor a publication to a chemistry loving and curious audience. My goal in this initiative is to provide a student’s perspective on sharing knowledge about the multifaceted and transversal nature of chemistry and the endless applications that this branch of science offers, thereby connecting chemists and budding chemists around the globe.
