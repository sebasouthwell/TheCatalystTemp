statement: ​I am an author for The Catalyst and a third year student at King’s College London finishing my BSc Chemistry. I aspire to one day work across various sectors of chemistry, to uncover all of its secrets. I joined this magazine not only due to my love of chemistry, journalism, and my hopes to flourish as a scientific journalist; but also in hopes of getting others as fascinated in our beautiful field as we are.
