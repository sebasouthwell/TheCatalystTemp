name: Reza Ahmad
team: Proofreaders
role: Proofreader
statement: I'm a third-year student on the Chemistry BSc. I joined the team as a proofreader as I want to ensure articles are accurate and interesting. My goal is to pique the interest of readers so that they may be inspired in their own chemistry journeys. The added benefit of this role is that I can further my own knowledge of various fields and maybe even forge my own path
