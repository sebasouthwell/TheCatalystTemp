statement: My name is Rohima Akhtar. I am currently studying Biomedical Science (with the foundation year). I joined this incredible magazine because I truly believe that, like a catalyst, we have the capabilities to provide you with an easier, alternate pathway that allows you to immerse yourself in the world of science - so that you can continually expand your knowledge. Learning about new subjects and constantly finding ways to improve myself are things that I enjoy the most. As such, I always find myself drawn to an array of hobbies such as learning new languages, reading, and anything creative!
