statement: I am one of the lead authors and am currently in my third year of study at Kingâ€™s College London on the MSci Chemistry Course. My interests lie in pharmaceuticals, as well as anything space-related. I co-founded this magazine to combine curiosity to discover more about what chemistry has to offer, with providing like-minded students and academics with a medium to do the same.

founding_statement: Having enjoyed writing since childhood, and being interested in exploring unknown topics, I decided to co-found this magazine to enhance my experience preparing for a career in chemistry. My vision for <i>The Catalyst</i> is to reach out to other (forming) chemists and show the potential, the variety, and the career options that our science has.
